# Active-Filter-Design
This is the assignment of the course _Active Filter Design_ that took place at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in the winter of 2019 and it consists of four individual parts. In each part we have to design a type of a filter which meets certain specifications given. To achieve the goal we analyze the systems in both Matlab and NI Multisim. The filters designed are mentioned below. 

* LowPass:	       Inverse Chebyshev 
* BandPass: 	     Butterworth 
* BandElimination: Inverse Chebyshev 
* HighPass:        Chebyshev
